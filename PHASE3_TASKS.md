# Phase 3: Real AI Model Integration - Task Breakdown

## 📋 Overview

This document breaks down Phase 3 into detailed, actionable tasks organized by component and priority. Each task includes acceptance criteria and dependencies.

Phase 3 implements Google Gemini AI model integration for resume enhancement. The enhancement process follows a sequential two-step approach: **Review** (analyze resume against job requirements) → **Modify** (enhance resume based on review findings). The architecture is designed to support future upgrade to agent-based approach with tools for iterative refinement.

**Intelligent Content Inference:** The AI can intelligently add related content based on what's already in the original resume. For example, if a resume mentions "Java", the AI can infer and add related terms like "backend development" or "server-side programming" since Java is commonly associated with backend work. This allows for natural enhancement while maintaining truthfulness - the AI only adds content that can be reasonably inferred from existing resume information.

**Status Legend:**
- ⬜ Not Started
- 🔄 In Progress

## 🎯 Goals

- Integrate Google Gemini AI model for resume enhancement
